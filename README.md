# Reduced Order Models for Parabolic PDEs using POD-Galerkin and POD-NN Methods

Welcome to this repository, where we explore the development of reduced-order models for solving parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). The work focuses on two distinct methods: the **POD-Galerkin** approach and the **POD-NN** (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with Neural Networks) approach.

## What's Inside

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to one of the methods:

1. **POD-Galerkin Method**: This notebook implements the classical POD-Galerkin method, where the solution of the PDE is approximated using a reduced basis obtained from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. The Galerkin projection is then used to derive a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that approximate the original PDE.

2. **POD-NN Method**: In this notebook, the POD method is combined with a neural network approach. The idea is to use a neural network to learn the dynamics of the reduced-order model, which can potentially offer better performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the traditional POD-Galerkin method.

## Getting Started

To explore these methods, simply open the notebooks in your Jupyter environment and follow along with the code and explanations. To run the notebooks, it is highly recommended to open them in Google Colab using the button provided at the beginning of each Jupyter notebook.
